              <h2>Who I am ðŸ˜Ž</h2>
              Hi! Iâ€™m <strong>Amna Ashraf</strong>, a passionate web developer who enjoys building clean, responsive, and user-friendly websites.
              My journey began around 2022â€“2023, and over time Iâ€™ve grown more confident in creating projects that bring ideas to life on the web.

              Right now, Iâ€™m exploring <b>React</b>, moving toward backend development, and learning modern UI design as I work toward becoming a <strong>Full-Stack Developer</strong>.
              My dream is to grow into a skilled Software Engineer who can handle both the creative and technical sides of applications.

              Coding ðŸ’» feels like a mix of art and problem-solving for me. Every project is a chance to experiment, learn something new, and sharpen my skills.

              Outside of coding, I love photography, experimenting with creative ideas, and exploring new technologies that spark curiosity ðŸš€.
              I also enjoy spending time with friends, discovering fresh perspectives, and learning from every challenge I take on.
            </p>
